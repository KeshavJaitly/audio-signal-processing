# Audio Signal Processing with FFT-Based Tone Control

This project focuses on audio signal analysis and modification using Fourier Transforms (FFTs) in Python. By transforming audio signals into the frequency domain, custom filters are applied to control bass, midrange, and treble levels, simulating tone control adjustments commonly found in audio equipment.

## Features

- **Signal Transformation**: Converts stereo audio to a mono signal and uses FFT to analyze its frequency components.
- **Tone Control Filters**: Implements frequency-domain filters to boost or cut bass, midrange, and treble frequencies, adjustable through user-defined "tone control" parameters.
- **Visualization**: Plots time-domain and frequency-domain representations, providing insights into how the tone control impacts the audio signal.
- **Audio Playback**: Reconstructs the modified signal with inverse FFT and plays back the tone-adjusted audio for direct comparison.

This project demonstrates practical applications of digital signal processing, particularly in audio modification, and provides hands-on experience with FFT-based filtering and tone control.
