This project explores audio signal analysis and modification using Fourier Transforms (FFTs) in Python. By transforming audio signals into the frequency domain, I apply custom filters to control bass, midrange, and treble levels, simulating tone control adjustments.

Features
Signal Transformation: Converts stereo audio to a mono signal and performs FFT to analyze its frequency components.
Tone Control Filters: Implements frequency-domain filters to boost or cut bass, midrange, and treble frequencies using adjustable "tone control" parameters.
Visualization: Plots both time-domain and frequency-domain representations to visualize how the tone control affects the signal.
Audio Playback: Reconstructs the modified signal using inverse FFT and plays back the tone-adjusted audio.
This project demonstrates practical applications of digital signal processing, particularly in audio modification, and provides a hands-on understanding of FFT-based filtering and audio tone control.
